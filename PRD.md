| Use Case                                      | Focus User         | User Story                                                                                     | Technical Implementation                                                                      |

| View and discover top bounty ideas           | Viewer/Donator     | As a viewer, I want to see the most funded bounty ideas so I can contribute to popular concepts.| Bounty page with ranking algorithm (sort by total donations, updated in real-time).           |
| Express interest without donating            | Viewer (non-donor) | As a viewer, I want to show interest in a bounty and receive notifications when submissions are open.| “Follow Bounty” button; notification system triggered at submission/voting stage.             |
| Start a new bounty idea with donation        | Viewer/Donator     | As a viewer, I must donate to kickstart a new bounty idea.                                     | Minimum donation validation; bounty creation form tied to payment flow.                      |
| Suggest similar existing bounty ideas        | Viewer/Donator     | As a viewer, when I try to create a new bounty, I want to be shown similar ideas so I can join forces instead.| Fuzzy search / semantic matching on bounty titles + tags; recommendation UI to redirect users.|
| Restrict role conflicts (donators ≠ creators)| Creator/Donator    | As a creator, I cannot donate to the bounty I compete in, and as a donator, I cannot compete in my own bounty.| Role validation checks in DB; enforce constraints before video submission or donation confirmation.|
| Tagging a video submission to a bounty       | Creator            | As a creator, I want to submit my video to a bounty so I can compete for donations.            | Video submission form with bounty selection dropdown (only eligible bounties shown).         |
| Stretch goals for bounties                   | Platform/Donator   | As a donator, I want to see extra rewards unlocked if the bounty passes milestones (e.g. company match funding).| Bounty config with milestone thresholds; dynamic progress bar; trigger events when thresholds reached.|
| Fair recommendation of competing videos during voting| Viewer             | As a viewer, I want all competing videos to be shown fairly and randomly, not biased by early popularity.| Voting feed: random shuffle per session; equal exposure algorithm to rotate all submissions.  |
| Hide leaderboard during voting               | Viewer             | As a viewer, I should not see current vote counts so I vote without bias.                      | Hide ranking metadata until voting ends; votes only stored server-side until reveal.         |
| Vote for favorite submissions                | Viewer             | As a viewer, I want to cast my vote for the bounty videos I enjoy.                             | Voting system tied to unique user ID; prevent multiple votes unless bounty-specific stretch goals unlock them.|
| Reveal winners after bounty ends             | All users          | As a user, I want to see the top 3 winning videos after the bounty ends.                       | Post-bounty reveal page; query sorted votes; mark winners; split donation prize pool between them.|
